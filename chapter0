Chapter 0: Prologue

[b]Battle of Mountain Pass[/b]
[b]1234 NE, Day 133[/b]

In the sky below the battlefield, one could spot two moving swarms of creatures. A copper and green skinned group that had set up camp on the beaches, and living grey metals that were blocking a passage that lead inward.

The weather had not been cooperative as of late. Strong winds and waves continuously belted against the ships owned by the invaders, pouring water into their boats and compromising hull integrity.

Meanwhile, water poured down from the dark clouds, making everything wet on land. Lighting and thunders descended as well.

It was getting to be a very miserable day.

Nonetheless, the two groups met on the battlefield in the forsaken rains.

[b]Marshall Asmund Furfire[/b]

There were so many green dots, as far as the eyes can see.

That what the dwarf Marshall Asmund Furfire thought as he looked at the battlefield in front of him. So many goblins, so many that want to ruin his home. How could his band of soldiers possibly survive the battle that is yet to come? By the end of it, his troops will be overrun and Furfire himself dead.

The Marshall quickly squashed that thought. It wasn't useful to think like that, not on the brink of the most important battle that IronGear had faced in many years.

The dwarf turned his back toward the soldiers. Even as the rain pelted heavily against his warriors, they had that look of determination in their eyes. Their face mighty grim even as their helmet hid their face. They stood sure and tall, their weapons ready to swing at a moment notice.

Somehow, Marshall felt assured. He could see his 300 winning against the overwhelming numbers that the goblins posed. Sheer folly, his mind told him. He chose to ignore it.

The dwarven commander walked back into the rear, the rows and columns of his small 'army' opening up a clear passage. A commander always leads in the rear.

[b]Fourth Der Dmung[/b]

Things had already went terribly wrong for the goblins. Their ships wrecked from the storm, and much of their supply lost to the ocean. So many murderous goblins at the beach, yet only one week supply of food remained. The other seven destroyed by the storm.

Not only that, many goblins didn't even have any armor at all, let alone any arms. Poorly equipped and poorly supplied, what could go wrong?

Bad rotten luck, yet nobody seemed to care. The mood was still jolly. The goblins sang of conquest yet to come, rather than wallow in the midst of a storm and a wrecked fleet.

[i]But that will all change very quickly[/i], Dmung thought. Most had never fought in a battle before, only told stories of victories and glories. Those that lost were killed down to the last man, and those that survived were butchered by his own countrymen for failure. And all rumors and mentions of defeat at the hand of their enemies are heresy, punishable by death. Dmung only survived by bluffing and lying. She went home with the name of a goblin she murdered.

"Ahoy!" a voice shouted. "Bet making time! Where's the commander?"

"That would be me," Dmung announced. She stepped outside the camp tent to face the bookmaker. Horde of blue colored helmets surrounded her and the lone tattered bookmaker.

"Good! We're currently betting on how many dwarves that the first wave will kill. Right now, most commanders all of them or nearly all. What will you choose?"

"Exactly zero. And I gamble everything we have."

The poorly armored bookkeeper's mouth was jaw slacked. "Are you sure???"

The commander's troops muttered noise of disbelief.

"You're crazy miss!" one of her blue minion bravely protested."There's no way that the dwarves will win the first battle! No way!"

Dmung glared hard at the outspoken minion. "Do you want to duel me to the death?"

"No," he quickly answered.

"Good. Do we have a deal?"

"Yes. Yes. You will lose, though."

The female commander smiled. "We'll see about that."

[b]First Battle[/b]

Overlooking the troop formation from a small mound, Furfire saw the first opponent of the day, a group of unruly red color coded goblins, twice the size of his group. They were poorly equipped and their lines were messy. Behind his opponents were goblin spectators of various other colors. There were lot of smiles and anticipation in their voices. Presumably, they were here to observe Marshall's defeat. That will not be happening.

"FIRE!" a nameless goblin commander yelled. Arrows were unleashed by his bowmen, though not quite at the same time.

"RAISE SHIELD!" Marshall countered. On instinct, his soldiers raised their shields all at once. The arrows slanted off the phalanx harmlessly.

"CHARGE!" the goblin commanded stupidly. The crazed goblins all charged in with reckless abandon. They slammed hard into the shield wall of Marshall's knights. Quick stabbing motions from the spears maimed and killed many of the goblins. Then they were pushed back by the shields.

Suddenly, there was a gap in the line.

"CHARGE!"

The goblins, all frightened, went in again. There were still hardly any hits to the shield walls. More fell, making the battle line an unwieldily place.

"STEP BACK!" Marshall barked. The goblins took the bait.

Fifteen percent of the attacking force were depleted. Ten or twenty individuals ran.

"COME BACK YOU TRAITORS!" the goblin commander yelled. "FORGET THEM DWARVES! KILL THEM! KILL THEM!" The red goblins were slow to respond to the command. It was a huge mess of confusion. Who's the traitors? Who's attacking them right now?

The troops in the back did manage to notice the traitors, so they gave chase. Meanwhile, the dwarves advanced upon the confused goblins line for more blows. They did not break formation or gave chase.

The dwarven line grinded through the goblin front, pushing the dead against the goblin line and impaling their opponents.

"SHIT! FUCK!" the red leader yelled. And there was a stab straight through his heart. By then the red soldiers were in full panic. Some of them froze. Some of them flailed their weapons.

Many tried to run back toward the safety of the larger goblin army. They were all killed as pathetic losers.

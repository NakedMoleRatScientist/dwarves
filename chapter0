[b]Battle of Mountain Pass[/b]
[b]234 NE[/b]

In the sky below the battefield, one could spot two moving swarms of creatures. A copper and green group that had set up camp on the beaches, and living grey metals that were blocking a passage that lead inward.

The weather had not been cooperative as of late. Strong winds and waves continuously belted against the ships owned by the invaders, pouring water into their boat and damaging their structure.

Meanwhile, water poured down from the dark cloud, making everything wet on land. Lighting and thunders descended as well.

It was getting to be a very miserable day.

Nonetheless, the two groups met on the battlefield in the forsaken rains.

[b]Marshall Asmund Furfire[/b]

There were so many green dots, as far as the eyes can see.

That what the dwarven Marshall Asmund Furfire thought as he looked at the battlefield in front of him. So many goblins, so many that want to ruin his home. How could his band of soldiers possibly survive the battle that is yet to come? By the end of it, his troops will be overrun and Furfire himself dead.

 Marshall quickly squashed that thought. It wasn't useful to think like that, not on the brink of the most important battle for IronGear.

 The dwarf turned his back toward the soldiers. Even as the rain pelted heavily against his warriors, they had that look of determination in their eyes. Their face mighty grim even as their helmet hid their face. They stood sure and tall, their weapons ready to swing at a moment notice.

 Somehow, Marshall felt assured. He could see his 300 winning against the overwhelming numbers that the goblins posed. Sheer folly, his mind told him. He chose to ignore it.

The dwarven commander walked back into the rear, the rows and columns of his small 'army' opening up a clear passage. A commander always lead from behind.

[b]Tenth Der Dmung[/b]

Things had already went terribly wrong for the goblins. Their ships wrecked from the storm, and much of their supply lost to the ocean. Over fifty thousands murderous goblins at the beach, yet only one week supply of food remained. The other seven destroyed by the storm. Many don't even have any armor at all, let alone any arms.

Bad rotten luck, yet nobody seemed to care. The mood was still jolly. The goblins sang of conquest yet to come, rather than wallowed in their terrible misery.

[i]But that will all change very quickly[/i], Dmung thought. Most had never fought in a battle before.
